The grass of the GitHub is related to Commit.

My the most green mow day is 2021/11/09

that day i created 120commits

because the github was created that day.

I haven't been able to do GitHub often these days.

This was because I focused all my energy 
on the Kaggle competition as a team project.

In addition, due to the nature of the competition, 
there was not much to commit.

My lawn is as green as Naver.

But the color of the grass 
I want comes out when I commit more than 30.

When can I get out of this commit hell?

Please, I want to grow my lawn in a non-artificial way.
